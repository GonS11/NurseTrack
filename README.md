## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**

NurseTrack leverages a modern, robust, and scalable technology stack to ensure efficient development, high performance, and a seamless user experience.

### **Backend:**

-   **[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot):** The leading framework for building high-performance, production-ready RESTful applications in Java.
-   **MySQL:** A reliable relational database management system, essential for storing and managing critical data such as user profiles, shift assignments, and request details.
-   **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Implemented for secure and stateless user authentication and authorization across the application.

### **Frontend:**

-   **[Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/):** A progressive JavaScript framework renowned for building interactive and high-performance user interfaces with its intuitive API and robust ecosystem.
-   **TypeScript:** Enhances frontend development with static type checking, leading to more robust and maintainable code.
-   **Vite:** A next-generation frontend tooling that provides an extremely fast development server and optimized build process for Vue applications.
-   **Sass:** Used for advanced CSS pre-processing, enabling more organized, maintainable, and dynamic stylesheets.

### **Infrastructure:**

-   **Docker:** Facilitates the deployment and management of services (backend, database) through lightweight, portable containers.
-   **Docker Compose:** An indispensable tool for orchestrating multi-container Docker applications, making local development environments easy to set up and manage.

## üåü **How to Run the Project**

To get NurseTrack up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### **Prerequisites:**

Ensure you have the following software installed:

-   **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
-   **Java Development Kit (JDK)** (v21)
-   **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (Docker Desktop or a similar Docker environment is recommended)

### **Steps to Run:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Start by cloning the NurseTrack GitHub repository to your local machine and navigating into the project directory.

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/GonS11/NurseTrack.git](https://github.com/GonS11/NurseTrack.git)
    cd NurseTrack
    ```

2.  **Start Backend and Database Services (using Docker Compose):**
    This command will build (if necessary) and start the backend Spring Boot application and the MySQL database in detached mode.

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

3.  **Verify Backend Readiness:**
    It's crucial to wait for the backend service to be fully operational before starting the frontend. You can monitor its health by accessing the Spring Boot Actuator endpoint.

    ```bash
    # You can also use curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
    # Or just open this URL in your browser:
    http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
    ```
    The backend is ready when the response displays: `"status": "UP"`.

4.  **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**
    Change your current directory to the frontend project.

    ```bash
    cd nurse-track-frontend
    ```

5.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    Install all the necessary npm packages for the Vue.js frontend.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

6.  **Run the Frontend in Development Mode:**
    This command will start the Vite development server, which includes Sass compilation, and hot-reloading for efficient frontend development.

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

7.  **Access the Application:**
    Once both backend and frontend services are running, you can access NurseTrack through your web browser.

    -   **Frontend (User Interface):** [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
    -   **Backend (API Base URL):** [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
